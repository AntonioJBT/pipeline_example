This folder was originally (still is) in ICL's HPC
/export131/home/aberlang/bin/ruffus_and_drmaa.dir

These were runs to test CGAT tools and pipelines, drmaa and ruffus in their HPC
(which has PBS, did not have drmaa or ruffus before)

The purpose here is to use these to test CGATPipelines core (ie only the
Pipeline module)
